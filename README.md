## Project & Challenges 
Python data analysis project to help with a marketing strategy for an online grocery store:  
* The sales team need to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviours differ. For example:
  * What´s the distribution among users in regard to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer´s loyalty status?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer´s region?
  * Is there
